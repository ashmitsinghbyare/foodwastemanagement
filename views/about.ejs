      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>FoodShare was founded in 2025 with a simple but powerful vision: to create a world where no good food goes to waste while people go hungry.</p>
      <p>We saw a disconnect in our communities - restaurants, stores, and individuals often had surplus food that would end up in landfills, while many people struggled to put meals on their tables. Our platform bridges this gap by connecting food donors directly with individuals and organizations that can put this food to good use.</p>
      <p>What started as a small local initiative has grown into a community of passionate donors and grateful receivers, all working together to reduce food waste and address food insecurity.</p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>At FoodShare, we're committed to these core principles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reduce Food Waste:</strong> Approximately one-third of all food produced globally is wasted. We're working to change that by ensuring surplus food reaches those who need it instead of landfills.</li>
        <li><strong>Fight Food Insecurity:</strong> Millions of people worldwide don't have reliable access to affordable, nutritious food. Our platform helps address this crisis at the community level.</li>
        <li><strong>Build Community Connection:</strong> We believe in the power of neighbors helping neighbors. Our platform fosters direct connections between food donors and recipients.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental Responsibility:</strong> Food waste is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. By reducing waste, we're also helping combat climate change.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>Our platform is designed to be simple, efficient, and effective:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Donors list food:</strong> Restaurants, grocery stores, event venues, and individuals can quickly list their surplus food, including details about quantity, pickup times, and expiration.</li>
        <li><strong>Receivers find food:</strong> Individuals, families, and community organizations in need can browse available food donations in their area.</li>
        <li><strong>Connection is made:</strong> Receivers request the food they need, and donors approve the requests.</li>
        <li><strong>Food is collected:</strong> Arrangements are made for pickup, reducing the logistical burden on both parties.</li>
        <li><strong>Community impact:</strong> Less food waste, less hunger, stronger communities, and a healthier planet.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Recycling and Composting</h2>
      <p>Organic waste can be composted to create nutrient-rich soil, reducing landfill use and greenhouse gas emissions. Composting methods range from traditional composting and vermicomposting to advanced systems like aerobic digestion.</p>
      <p>Community composting initiatives are also gaining traction, especially in urban areas, where local solutions help reduce food waste and create sustainable food systems.</p>

      <h2>Energy Recovery</h2>
      <p>Food waste can be converted into biogas through anaerobic digestion, which provides a renewable energy source. This process reduces waste and helps produce energy for communities.</p>
      <p>Energy recovery not only reduces food waste but also contributes to local energy production, offering a sustainable solution to both waste and energy needs.</p>
